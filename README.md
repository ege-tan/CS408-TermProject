# 🌐 CS 408 - Computer Networks (Fall 2024)

This repository contains my coursework and **Cloud File Storage and Publishing** project for **CS 408: Computer Networks**. This course provided in-depth knowledge of **computer networks**, **TCP socket programming**, and **client-server architecture** through hands-on implementation.

## 📌 What I Learned

### 🔹 Computer Networks & Protocols
- Gained a solid understanding of **network architectures, protocols, and communication models**.
- Learned about **TCP/IP stack**, **socket programming**, and how client-server systems operate over networks.
- Understood **error handling, concurrency, and synchronization** in distributed systems.

### 🔹 TCP Socket Programming
- Implemented a **client-server model** using **TCP sockets** for **file transfer**.
- Managed **multiple simultaneous client connections** with **concurrent threading**.
- Handled **data packet transmission, error handling, and message parsing** efficiently.

### 🔹 Cloud File Storage System
- Designed and implemented a **networked file storage** system where clients can:
  - **Upload, download, delete, and update** files in a shared cloud storage.
  - View a **dynamic file directory** that lists available files and their owners.
- Implemented **persistent storage**, ensuring files remain available even after server shutdown.

### 🔹 Multi-Client Communication
- Managed **multiple TCP connections** to handle simultaneous client requests.
- Implemented **client name uniqueness** to prevent duplicate logins.
- Developed mechanisms for **real-time notifications** when files are uploaded or downloaded.

### 🔹 GUI-Based Networked Applications
- Built a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for both the **client and server**.
- Integrated **file browsing, real-time logs, and connection controls** within the GUI.
- Ensured proper **error handling and user feedback** for failed operations.

### 🔹 Secure & Robust System Design
- Prevented **race conditions and data corruption** with structured request handling.
- Implemented **file ownership restrictions**, ensuring only owners can modify/delete their files.
- Designed a **fault-tolerant system** where disconnections and errors do not crash the server or clients.

## 📌 Key Takeaways from the Project
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Implementing real-world **networked applications** with proper request handling.
- **Concurrency Management:** Using **multi-threading** to handle multiple clients efficiently.
- **Data Persistence:** Ensuring files remain stored even after system restarts.
- **GUI Design for Networking:** Creating an **interactive** and **user-friendly** networking application.
- **Debugging & Error Handling:** Managing connection failures, incorrect requests, and user errors.
